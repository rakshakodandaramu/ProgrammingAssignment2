###Loading Data
we have deleted thoe coloumns with NA (nothing) and few more coloumns which not related to predict
split data to training and testing


 library(caret)
set.seed(12463)
 
 training <- read.csv("C:/Course Work/Machine learning/Courseera/R/machine learnin course/pml-training.csv")
 training$classe <- as.factor(training$classe)
 training <- training[,-nearZeroVar(training)]> training <- training[,-c(1,2,3,4,5,6,7)]
 
inTrain <- createDataPartition(y=training$classe, p=0.75, list=FALSE)
 training <- training[inTrain,]
 testing <- training[-inTrain,]


### preprocessing data


 preObj <- preProcess(training[,-length(training)],method=c("center", "scale", "knnImpute", "pca"), thresh=0.9)
 clean_data <- predict(preObj,training[,-length(training)])
